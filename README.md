Project description-This application is a Leadership Conference project that consists of groups of two (2) or three (3) members, Grades 9 through 12, developing an app to test the knowledge of FBLA. This application covers the different topics of “Competitive Events”, “Ribbons”, “FBLA Officers”, “FBLA Organization”, “Events”, “Publications”, “FBLA History”, and “The Facts”. The application is accessible for deployment on a smartphone, tablet, or both. The application runs standalone with no programming errors. It includes a licensing and terms of use.

Instruction for Installation: Open the “App Store” application on your mobile device and search the following: “In the Know FBLA”. Access the application that has a black head with gears and a white backdrop logo titled “In the Know FBLA”. Click download and enter your Apple ID, if necessary. Once successfully downloaded, open the application on your home screen.  

How to run the tests: In the event that the application “In the Know FBLA” is not running correctly, a test would provide information on how to fix the current issue(s). At the top left hand corner of the “Xcode” application is a play button. Click this button and the application will run to find errors and warnings. Specific warnings and errors will be given as you will not be able to access the application if errors are present.

Instruction for Use: Once the application “In the Know FBLA” is open, you will see an initial screen. Next, it will take you to the licensing and terms of use for this application. Once you agree to the agreement, it will take you to the topic pages. There is eight different topics to be quizzed upon. Each one is similar to the other in design. Each topic has ten different questions with four multiple choice answers and only one is correct. Once you answer the question, a label will appear stating “wrong” or “right”. If correct, you will be able to move on the to the next question. If wrong, you must answer the question correctly to move on to the next question.
